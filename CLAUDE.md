# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

**Development:**
```bash
pnpm dev              # Start development server with Contentlayer2 build and Turbopack
pnpm build            # Build for production
pnpm build:content    # Build Contentlayer2 content only
pnpm start            # Start production server
```

**Code Quality:**
```bash
pnpm lint             # Run ESLint
pnpm eslint:fix       # Run ESLint with auto-fix
pnpm prettier         # Format code with Prettier
```

**Pre-commit hooks are configured with Husky and lint-staged.**

## Architecture

This is a **Next.js 15 blog** using the App Router with TypeScript and React 19. The site is built in Korean language with a focus on tech and personal notes.

### Content Management
- **Contentlayer2** transforms MDX files in `/posts/` into type-safe data
- Two content types: `TechPost` (`posts/tech/`) and `NotesPost` (`posts/notes/`)
- MDX processing includes: syntax highlighting (Prism), GitHub Flavored Markdown, and minification
- Posts have frontmatter: `title`, `date`, `summary`, `tags`, `draft`
